Lilo and Mike are recently married and have set off in their TARDIS, which goes
by the name of Atlas, to explore all of time and space together.
Atlas' chameleon circuit is, of course, working, and as Lilo and Mike are
currently travelling in 21st century Europe, it has taken on the appearance of
a campervan.
