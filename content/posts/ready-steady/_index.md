Lilo and Mike were originally due to leave in May, but their journey had to be postponed due to the pandemic. <br />
Now they are finally ready to set off on their adventures, and their friends want to wish them all the best...


## Dear Lilo and Mike,

*Roads go ever ever on,* <br/>
*Over rock and under tree,* <br/>
*By caves where never sun has shone,* <br/>
*By streams that never find the sea;* <br/>
*Over snow by winter sown,* <br/>
*And through the merry flowers of June,* <br/>
*Over grass and over stone,* <br/>
*And under mountains in the moon.*

*Roads go ever ever on* <br/>
*Under cloud and under star,* <br/>
*Yet feet that wandering have gone* <br/>
*Turn at last to home afar.* <br/>
*Eyes that fire and sword have seen* <br/>
*And horror in the halls of stone* <br/>
*Look at last on meadows green* <br/>
*And trees and hills they long have known.*

I wish you lots of fun on your own adventure!
