Lilo and Mike were originally due to leave in May, but their journey had to be postponed because of the pandemic. <br />
Now they are finally ready to set off on their adventures, and their friends want to wish them all the best...


## Dear Lilo and Mike,

*Roads go ever ever on,* <br/>
*Over rock and under tree,* <br/>
*By caves where never sun has shone,* <br/>
*By streams that never find the sea;* <br/>
*Over snow by winter sown,* <br/>
*And through the merry flowers of June,* <br/>
*Over grass and over stone,* <br/>
*And under mountains in the moon.*

*Roads go ever ever on* <br/>
*Under cloud and under star,* <br/>
*Yet feet that wandering have gone* <br/>
*Turn at last to home afar.* <br/>
*Eyes that fire and sword have seen* <br/>
*And horror in the halls of stone* <br/>
*Look at last on meadows green* <br/>
*And trees and hills they long have known.*

I wish you lots of fun on your own adventure!

*May the road rise to meet you,* <br/>
*May the wind be always at your back.* <br/>
*May the sun shine warm upon your face,* <br/>
*The rains fall soft upon your fields.* <br/>
*And until we meet again,* <br/>
*May God hold you in the hollow of his hand.* <br/>

Wishing you both blessings for the road - on your honeymoon travels and on your journey together through life.

*We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one.*

Congratulations on getting married and all the best for your travels! <br/>
May your story be beautiful and exciting and filled with love and laughter!

At the very end of C.S. Lewis's book "The Horse and His Boy", the horse Bree, who believes that Aslan is only a metaphorical lion, is confronted with Aslan himself, in all his golden glory. Bree tries to run away but Aslan tells him: "You poor, proud frightened horse, draw near. Nearer still, my son. Do not dare not to dare. Touch me, smell me. Here are my paws, here is my tail, these are my whiskers." Bree stops running and decides to trust in the lion, no matter how scary the beast may be.

Life, too, is scary sometimes ‚Äì a lot of times really, but the two of you aren't easily scared and you have made two big decisions: to get married and to see more of this world. You dared. You're off now, maybe not so much to smell new smells (tbh, lions don't smell all that good anyway) but definitely to touch and to see and to hear and to taste and to experience.

I hope you'll find excitement and calm, see the bright colours of the heather in Scotland as well as the building blocks of castles, darkened by history, walk on young grass and lean against old trees, hear the true silence of the night at a loch, as well as the music of big cities and taste figs, dusty and still warm from the sun.

Be safe, my dears. Enjoy your travels and each other's company.

And bring me back a few fridge magnets.

All roads lead to Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø - Sun, sea, sand & midges. <br/>
We will supply midge repellent when you arrive!

It's not that I mind you going away, </br>
it's just that I feel a little jealous of the folks who'll get to meet you. <br/>
Maybe also just a tiny bit sorry for them, too. <br/>

Sally forth, younglings, and bring back some songs and stories.

*Not the bee upon the blossom,* <br/>
*In the pride o' sunny noon;* <br/>
*Not the little sporting fairy,* <br/>
*All beneath the simmer moon;* <br/>
*Not the poet, in the moment* <br/>
*Fancy lightens in his e'e,* <br/>
*Kens the pleasure, feels the rapture,* <br/>
*That thy presence gi'es to me.*

The world is your oyster, go and find the pearls. Have fun, try everything, stay safe, miss us lots, and bring back chocolates and exotic wines. And remember we love you.
