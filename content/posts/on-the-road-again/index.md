We are back! 

Mike spent two days cutting a hole in the bathroom, fixing the pipes and then carefully replacing the hole. Apparently the pipes are not entirely secure yet, but if all goes well that will be remedied tonight when we are in Nürnberg. 

We also used the chance to clean our awning, reorganize and sort out some of our clothes and other things that we realized we don’t actually need and, of course, cuddled the cat. She is so very fluffy. 

And then, after all was said and done we tentatively left again, hoping that this time nothing would break. It only took about 2 hours before the second cupboard in the bathroom decided it had had enough of being shut all the time and so discarded it’s door. The previous owner had tried to fix that with Duct tape. We will try and find a more permanent solution. 

Other than that the past day has been pretty uneventful, if happy. We went shopping and brunching with friends and then went down to Neumarkt where we have a long to do list to work off. Amongst other things we had to go to the Doctors (sadly not the spacey one) to make sure all our vaccinations are in order, fill up our gas and remind an old boss (from over two years ago) to please, pretty please write a work reference that can be used for a CV. 

It still doesn’t quite feel like we’re actually on the road, but in a few days we will be in unknown territory (where the zombies and the french live), so we will see how we feel then. 

Until then,

Lilo and Mike
