      <description>Lilo and Mike got married in April 2020. Their journey was delayed by Covid-19, but now they have left everything behind to go on the journey of a lifetime with nothing but their TARDIS (aka campervan), Atlas.
Lilo has trained as a nurse. Her hobbies include drawing, crafts, digital art and writing stories - hopefully she&amp;rsquo;ll find time for those in between adventures!
Mike is a stone mason and a fantastic cook.</description>
