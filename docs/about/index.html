   <p>Lilo and Mike got married in April 2020. Their journey was delayed by Covid-19,
but now they have left everything behind to go on the journey of a lifetime with
nothing but their TARDIS (aka campervan), Atlas.</p>
<div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
<p>Lilo has trained as a nurse. Her hobbies include drawing, crafts, digital art and
writing stories - hopefully she&rsquo;ll find time for those in between adventures!</p>
<p>Mike is a stone mason and a fantastic cook. He loves being outdoors and is super
enthusiastic about anything to do with DIY, especially if it was also done by
Vikings.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed from the theme of the website, the two of them are also
huge geeks (Mike has an awesome collection of t-shirts!) and are following in the
footsteps of everyone&rsquo;s favourite time-lord to experience as much as they possibly
can of the world.</p>
