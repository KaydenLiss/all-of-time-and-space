There was a lot of different information flying around. Some websites said you can only cross the border to France if you have a negative Covid test that is less than 72 hours old, there was some hassle before we finally worked out if we had to self isolate in the UK, since we had to go through France (the answer being no, but only as long as we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop in France and leave our car) and the Covid-form we had to fill out before entering the UK wanted addresses of our stay, which of course we don&amp;rsquo;t really have.</description>
