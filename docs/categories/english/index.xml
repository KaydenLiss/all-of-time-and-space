      <description>Heute mal zweigeteilt, der erste Teil auf Deutsch,der zweite auf Englisch.
Wir waren in York, Heimat des York Minsters, eine gotische Kathedrale von immenser Größe und Schönheit. Als eine der größten Kathedralen Europas hat sie große Bedeutung für die Architektur und Bauweise der damaligen Zeit. Besonders bedeutsam sind ihre gewaltigen Glasfenster, nicht nur wegen ihrer aufwendigen Herstellung und Schönheit sondern auch und vor allem ihrer Größe wegen.
Die “fünf Nonnen”, fünf direkt nebeneinandergelegene schlanke Spitzbogenfenster, beispielsweise haben eine Höhe von mehr als einem Tennisplatz!</description>

      <description>We made it!  We had three days of preparation, hours of planning and discussions and one day of relaxing by the river before we drove to Calais.
There was a lot of different information flying around. Some websites said you can only cross the border to France if you have a negative Covid test that is less than 72 hours old, there was some hassle before we finally worked out if we had to self isolate in the UK, since we had to go through France (the answer being no, but only as long as we didn&amp;rsquo;t stop in France and leave our car) and the Covid-form we had to fill out before entering the UK wanted addresses of our stay, which of course we don&amp;rsquo;t really have.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since we last posted anything. For the most part that is because we haven’t really been doing anything super exciting.
We visited Frankfurt for a day, where we got some super cool sleeping bags from my godfather (thank you, again!!!) and then spent a couple of days by another lake where we spent most of our time just swimming and relaxing.
And now we are in Heidelberg.</description>

      <description>We are back!
Mike spent two days cutting a hole in the bathroom, fixing the pipes and then carefully replacing the hole. Apparently the pipes are not entirely secure yet, but if all goes well that will be remedied tonight when we are in Nürnberg.
We also used the chance to clean our awning, reorganize and sort out some of our clothes and other things that we realized we don’t actually need and, of course, cuddled the cat.</description>

      <title>A Jolly Good Fellow</title>

      <description>Yesterday was Mike’s birthday. Can you believe it, he is actually old now. Since I am seven months younger I take great joy in reminding him of that fact. Every year. See why our relationship works so well?
The day started out only semi-good. The spot we had chosen to camp at the previous night (near Neumarkt i.d. Opf) turned out to be right by a large traffic road and a building site, which meant we were woken loudly when the rest of the world decided they wanted to do nothing more than get to work.</description>

      <description>Ladies, Gents and people Non-gender,
after weeks of renovating, repairing, sewing and throwing out things just for the heck of it, we are now officially off!
Well…. When I say we‘re off, we left last night (at 5 minutes to Midnight, just because I like the name of the song) and managed - drumroll - three kilometers! And what an adventure that was: Up steep hills and down scary valleys (well… one of each), right up to a thousand year old oak tree, where we set up camp for the night.</description>

      <description>Lilo and Mike were originally due to leave in May, but their journey had to be postponed because of the pandemic. Now they are finally ready to set off on their adventures, and their friends want to wish them all the best&amp;hellip;
Dear Lilo and Mike, Roads go ever ever on,  Over rock and under tree,  By caves where never sun has shone,  By streams that never find the sea;  Over snow by winter sown,  And through the merry flowers of June,  Over grass and over stone,  And under mountains in the moon.</description>
